=====
Cloud Computing - the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.

On-Premise:
* You own the servers and hire IT people
* Pay/rent the real-estate
* Take all the risk

Cloud Providers:
* Someone else owns the servers and hires the IT people
* Someone else pays or rents the real-estate
* You are responsible for configuring cloud services and code, someone else takes care of the rest

**Dedicated Server**
One physical machine dedicated to single a business.
Runs a single web-app/site.
***Very expensive, high maintenance, high security.***

**Virtual Private Server (VPS)**
One physical machine dedicated to a single business. 
The physical machine is virtualized into sub-machines.
Runs multiple web-apps/sites
***Better utilization and isolation of resources***

**Shared Hosting**
One physical machine, shared by hundreds of businesses.
Relies on most tenants under-utilizing their resources.
***Very cheap, limited functionality, poor isolation***

**Cloud Hosting** (Cloud also includes the above use-cases)
Multiple physical machines that act as one system.
The system is abstracted into multiple cloud services
***Flexible, scalable, cost-effective, high configurabliity***

AWS was launched in 2006 and is the leading cloud service provider. CSP = Cloud Service Provider.

* Simple Queue Service (SQS) was the first AWS service launched for public use in 2004.
* Simple Storage Service (S3) was launched in March of 2006.
* Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) was launched in August of 2006 and still remains their most used service.
* In 2010, it was reported all of amazon's retail sites had migrated to AWS.
* To support training and skill standardization, AWS began offering a certification program for computer engineers on April 2013.

### What is a CSP?

A CSP is a company which provides multiple cloud services tens to hundreds of services.
Those cloud services can be chained together to create cloud architectures.
Those cloud services are accessible via Single Unified API eg. AWS API
Those cloud services utilized metered billing based on usage eg. per second, per hour.
Those cloud services have rich monitoring built in eg. AWS CloudTrail.
Those cloud services have an infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering.
Those cloud services offer automation via infrasctructure as code (IaC)

If a company offers multiple cloud services under a single UI but do not meet most of or all of these requirements it will be referred to as a cloud platform (Twilio, HashiCorp, Databricks)

## Landscape of CSPs
Tier 1: Early to market, wide offering, strong synergies between services, well recognized in the industry. AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Alibaba Cloud.

Tier 2: Backed by well-known tech companies, slow to innovate and turned to specialization. IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud, Rackspace (OpenStack)

Tier 3: Virtual Private Servers (VPS) turned to offer code IaaS offering. Simple, cost-effective. Vultr, Digital Ocean, Linode.

## Common Cloud Services

A CSP can have hundreds of cloud services that are grouped into various types of services. The four most common types of cloud services (the 4 core) for Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) would be:

1. Compute (EC2: Imagine having a virtual computer that can run applications, programs, and code.
2. Storage: Imagine having a virtual hard-drive that can store files.
3. Networking: Imagine having virtual network defining internet connections or network isolations between services or outbound to the internet
4. Imagine a virtual database for storing reporting data or a database for general purpose web-applications.

AWS has over 200+ cloud services.

Other categories outside of the 4 core:
Analytics, application integration, ar and vr, aws cost management, blockchain, business applications, containers, customer engagement, dev tools, end user computing, game tech, IoT, machine learning, management and governance, media services, migration and transfer, mobile, quantum technologies, robotics, satellites, security identity and compliance.
